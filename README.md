Join the fight against climate change. Terramater is the Roman goddess of Earth, a precious being who we rely on so heavily but never care for. This is an attempt to shake people awake. Featuring two Scratch games also built by the team, Terramater informs about only a sliver of the causes and effects of climate change. Please navigate with an open mind. Thank you.
